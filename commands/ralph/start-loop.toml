prompt = """
Start a new Ralph Loop for this task: {{args}}

## Instructions

1. Call the `ralph_init_loop` tool with the prompt: "{{args}}"

2. Once the loop is initialized, analyze the task and create an implementation plan.

3. Begin working on the first step.

4. After each meaningful step or iteration:
   - Call `ralph_increment_iteration` to record progress and get the next iteration number.
   - Update your internal state based on the tool output.

5. Continue working until the goal is achieved.

6. When finished, output: <done>COMPLETE</done>

Remember: Your files persist between iterations. Always check existing files before creating new ones.
