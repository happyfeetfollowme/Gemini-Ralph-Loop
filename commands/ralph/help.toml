# Ralph Loop Help

Ralph Loop is an iterative development system that enables autonomous, self-referential development cycles.

## Commands

- `/ralph:start-loop <task>` - Initialize and start a new development loop.
- `/ralph:status` - Check the current progress and status of the loop.
- `/ralph:pause` - Pause the current loop.
- `/ralph:resume` - Resume a paused loop.
- `/ralph:complete` - Mark the loop as successfully completed.
- `/ralph:cancel` - Stop and cancel the current loop.
- `/ralph:history` - View the iteration history.
- `/ralph:checkpoint <name>` - Create a named checkpoint of the current state.
- `/ralph:restore <name>` - Restore the state from a named checkpoint.
- `/ralph:reset` - Clear all Ralph Loop state and data.
- `/ralph:iterate <note>` - Record progress for the current step.

## Quick Start

1. Start a loop: `/ralph:start-loop "Build a calculator app"`
2. Work on the task. Gemini will track your iterations automatically.
3. Record progress: `/ralph:iterate "Added UI layout"`
4. When finished, output: `<done>COMPLETE</done>`

## State Management

Ralph Loop state is managed via MCP tools. The state directory can be customized using the `RALPH_STATE_DIR` environment variable. By default, it uses `.ralph-state/` in the current directory.
